# 0.2.0

## Changes

- [BREAKING]: Feat: Svu now is no longer dependant on SvelteKit, so should work in the Svelte REPL (or fallback gracefully). This means the svu/svelte export will be removed.
- [BREAKING]: FIX: type KeyMap is now capitalised.
- [BREAKING]: Scoped the default class for use:active. It changed from 'active' to 'svu-active'.
- FIX: localstore was not always working flawlessly
- FEAT: localstore is based on resettable and contains a flag showing wether or not storage api is available
- FEAT: added sessionstore with the same interface as localstore.
- FIX: Fixes a bug in portal where passing in a HTMLElement didn't work.
- DOCS: Various small docstring improvements
