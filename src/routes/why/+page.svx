# Why

Svelte and SvelteKit make web development easy and fun. No wonder it's the [most loved web framework][survey] in the world. Although Svelte, especially in conjunction with SvelteKit is fairly batteries-included, there are a bunch of small things they rightfully leave up to the developer.

This package aims to be a collection of all of those small things that bring a little spark of joy to your next Svelte(Kit) app.

## Principles

Some design principles:

- ü•á `One dev dependency`

  The utilities by themselves are too small to warrant their own package. In the past, I have manually copied them from project to project for exactly that reason.

- üîã `Batteries Included`

  svu comes with a actions, stores, utility-functions and more. The real value is in the fact that everything you need is at your fingertips.

- ü™∂ `Small sizes please`

  The library is fully tree shakeable so it's safe too include even if you need just one utillity. It won't harm your bundle size.

- ‚ù§Ô∏è `Pareto Principle`

  These utilities are designed to solve 80% of usecases with 20% of the code. It might well be that your specific use-case outgrows the capabilities of a specific svu. No hard feelings! The docs will tell you were to find more elaborate packages, if applicable.
